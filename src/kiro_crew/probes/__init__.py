"""Probes: the domain half of a watch, one module per kind of subject.

A probe answers exactly two questions about one external subject -- *what is it*
(:meth:`~kiro_crew.irq.Probe.identity`) and *what does it look like right now*
(:meth:`~kiro_crew.irq.Probe.observe`) -- and nothing else. Everything generic
lives in :mod:`kiro_crew.irq`: state persistence, per-epoch reset, time-bounded
dedupe, the coalescing window, and the consecutive-failure backstop.

Probes live here rather than beside a driver because a probe outlives its
drivers. The gh-pr probe was written for a script cron and is now also driven
in-process by the auto-nudge scheduler; a probe owned by one driver would have
had to be copied for the second, and two copies of a classifier drift.

    ``None`` is a supported answer, not an error: a monitor whose subject has no

    silence. The caller decides that; this function only reports capability.

    Still a branch rather than a registration API, now with two kinds. A registry
    pays for itself when a kind arrives from OUTSIDE this package -- a plugin, a
    separately shipped app -- because then no single file can name them all. Both
    kinds live here, no caller outside ``kiro_crew`` adds one, and
    ``register()`` / ``kinds()`` would be an interface with one user apiece whose
    only effect is to move this mapping somewhere a reader has to search for.
    Revisit at the third kind, or at the first one shipped from elsewhere.

    ``worker_running`` is consumed only by the work-ledger probe (see
    :mod:`kiro_crew.probes.work_ledger` for why it takes it as a value). It is
    accepted here rather than at the call site so the kind-to-probe mapping stays
    in ONE place: a driver that constructed one probe itself and asked this
